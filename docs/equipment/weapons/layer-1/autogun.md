# Autogun

The Autogun is our everyman rifle. It can do a little bit of everything and is the most commonly used weapon in the Armory.

# Attachments

* The Autogun has two under-barrel attachments.
    * A Grenade Launcher which can be equipped with the command `/1 gl`
       * A Shotgun Shell can be loaded with the command `/1 buck`
    * A Bayonet can be equipped with the command `/1 bayo`.
        * The Bayonet collects "skulls," which can be turned in for corruption.

- All of these attachments are fired or used by crouching.
    - Hitting the **C** Key on your keyboard or **PGDN** if you're a southpaw.
