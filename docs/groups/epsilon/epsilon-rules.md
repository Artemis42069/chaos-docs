#                                     //Welcome to The Araxian Metroplex!//

We're all about having fun here, so we keep the rules pretty limited. Don't make us change that. thx


+ LBA Variants Only // Legacy Armor types are not permitted for use at this sim. LBA Variants that are hosted on the github @ https://github.com/Krutchen/SLMCLBA are permitted for use at Araxia. You can apply for an exception but do not expect approval.

+ Client Side Assists are forbidden // Usage of Wireframe, Hitboxes or Pre-jump disabling is not allowed. If this is discovered to be in use we will request it to be disabled/reenabled.

+ Maximum LBA health for Deployables is 50 HP / Walls a max of 100 // Self explanatory

+ Maximum LBA health for Ground Vehicles is 500HP // Self explanatory

+ Maximum LBA health for Aircraft is 200HP // Fleetships are the exception to this. Fleetship health is to be limited to 500.

+ Safe Zones // Both spawns are safe zones. Attempts to fire into either spawn will kill you automatically. If you attempt to breach into the defender spawn, attacker spawn will be glassed repeatedly.

+ Harassment // Don't be a toxic shithead. Talking shit is fine but there is a limit to that. Don't be a pylon bud.

+ Movement Enhancers // Butt packs that allow horizontal or vertical movement are permitted on a case by case basis. At a future date we will provide one in the spawn for anyone without. Air strafes are stupid, don't use those. Dodge rolls and slides must have a reasonable cool down between uses. [ Reasonable is up to defending OIC. ]

Always Allowed Enhancers
            - Chaos Assault Pack
            - Chaos Grav-Chute
            - ESC Butt Pack


        Banned Movement Enhancers:
            - AN Jetpacks
            - Theatre Run & Jump or Dash
            - Airstrafes

+ Grapples are NOT ALLOWED currently. At a later date we will provide a grapple in the spawn that fits the sim specifications.

+ No Griefing // Griefing can be defined as intentionally causing script time or fps of the sim or users on the region to decrease by a large amount through intentional attacks. In example: GPU Crashing, repeated rezzing of non-combat objects and other similar actions.

+ Weaponry Rules // Guns and the like must have a limit to the amount of shots prior to reload that is reasonable for the type of weapon it is. If its an Assault Rifle it'd make zero sense for it to have 300 rounds before reloading. Don't be lame.
+ Agentlist weaponry is not permitted @ Araxia

+ Mines & Deployable Limits // Mines are limited to 5 per person max. Deployables are 2 of each type per person.

+ Rooftops // Stay off of them. Roof Koreans will snipe and kill you automatically if you test this. If you don't die to the koreans, you will be asked to keep off. If you continue to break this, you will be autokilled or ejected.

+ Sithacking to unaccessible areas will result in death and a fatwa upon your family.
